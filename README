This is the outgrowth of the first open-ended project given to us at Dev Bootcamp (www.devbootcamp.com). I wrote the original Craigslist scraper with one other student and subsequently rewrote the program from scratch to better meet my vision for the project. This is my first attempt at a comprehensive program after only two weeks of working seriously with Ruby, so go easy on me!
